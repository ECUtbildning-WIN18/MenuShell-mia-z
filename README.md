README file for MenuShell v1.2
to make sure this works properly:
Assumes you log into the sql server (located at 127.0.0.1) with following credentials:
Username: SA (system administrator)
Password: Ryan2134! (Arbitrary "strong" password that meets the required standard)
3 Accounts are created upon execution, 2 dummy accounts with vet role and an admin account which you SHOULD be using to test
The login details are: 
login: admin 
password: 123
Of course, all this info is easily available if you wanna dig through the code, reading this file is easier however - and I've never made a readme file that's actually useful!
